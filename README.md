# Cardano JS Sample

This simple application shows how to use Cardano Nami Wallet JavaScript capabilities to operate in the Cardano blockchain using pure JavaScript.  

For those who are familiar with React, everything is self-explanable in `App.js`.

This app expects that Nami Wallet is loaded. It shows a button to connect to wallet and when the wallet is connected, shows its balance.
## Running
In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
